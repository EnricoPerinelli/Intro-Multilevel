  organiz   !this is the cluster variable
  job_perf  !job performance
  boss_exp  !experience of boss
  OCB       !organizational citizenship behavior

  cluster = organiz; !this variable defines the cluster

  within = OCB;

  define: center OCB (grandmean);
  !grand mean centering the independent variable, so to have a meaningful
  !interpetation of the intercept

  analysis: type= twolevel random;
  !"random" allows the inclusion of a random slope

  model: %within%
         beta1j | job_perf on OCB;
         !beta1j is a random name to indicate random slope

  output: sampstat stdyx;



*** WARNING in OUTPUT command
  STANDARDIZED (STD, STDY, STDYX) options are available only for TYPE=TWOLEVEL RANDOM
  with ESTIMATOR=BAYES.  Request for STANDARDIZED (STD, STDY, STDYX) is ignored.
